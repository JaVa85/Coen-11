Division Test
  Do 10 times
    Generate two numbers between 0 and 12 randomlyâ€“divisor (cannot be zero) and quotient
    Output the dividend (divisor * quotient) and the divisor
    Input the answer
    Compare the answer with the quotient
    Output right or wrong
    If the answer is wrong, output the quotient
    Count the number of correct answers
  Show the total score to the user
  
  To generate the random numbers
    divisor = rand ( ) % 12 + 1;
    quotient = rand ( ) % 13;
    before the loop, call srand once
      srand ((int) time (NULL));
      
 Create a function to handle each division
    The main function generates the numbers and passes them as arguments to the division function
    The division function returns 1 if the user is right and 0 if the user is wrong
    The main function counts the number of right answers in the loop
