The waiting list is created interactively with the following commands
     1 name number – insert a node with the name and number of people specified in the corresponding list
     2 table_size– show and delete the oldest node with number<= table_size from the best list (start from the closest and move up)
     3 – print the list for each range: name and number, from oldest to newest
     4 character (new) – count the occurrences of the given character in the names
     5 – show all the names backwards
     6 – save and quit
  
Requirements
     Array of lists
     Names cannot repeat
     Free all the nodes before quitting
        •(new) the function must be recursive
    (new) When showing all the names backwards, use a recursive function which should be called for each name
