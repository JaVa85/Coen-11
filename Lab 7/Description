The waiting list is created interactively with the following commands
     1 name number – insert a node with the name and number of people specified in the corresponding list
     2 table_size – show and delete the oldest node with number <= table_size from the best list (start from the closest and move up)
     3 – print the list for each range: name and number, from oldest to newest
     4 – save and quit
    
Requirements
   Array of lists
   Names cannot repeat
   Free all the nodes before quitting
