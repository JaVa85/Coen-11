The waiting list is created interactively with the following commands
     insert name number– insert a node with the name and number of people specified
     search size – extract (show and delete) oldest node with a number <= size
     list– print the list, name and number, from oldest to newest
     quit– quit
    
Do not allow names to repeat
   Check the list before inserting
Keep your list in the oldest-to-newest order
   Always insert a new entry at the end
   A tail pointer pointing to the last node makes it more efficient
To list
   Traverse the list using the pointers
