   Your insert function should have the following type:
      • void insert (char *, int);
   Read the name and number to local variables (char array and int) before calling the insert function.
   Names cannot repeat!
      • Need to deal with that before calling function insert
   Use function fseek to read the beginning of the file (header) before reading the data (names/numbers).
      • Type <man fseek> to learn how to use the function
   Add two functions•void save_data (char *);
      • void read_data (char *);
   Both receive the name of the file as argument.
